# Apigility PHP Heroku Build Pack

## What makes it unique?

* Supports 5.4 and 5.5
* Uses the memory of the dyno more efficiently by going with NGINX and PHP-FPM.
* Supports Composer 
* Dynamic installing of [supported extensions](support/ext) listed as `ext-` requirements in `composer.json`.

## How to use it

Use the `--buildpack` parameter when creating a new app:

    heroku create --buildpack https://github.com/svenanders/heroku-apigility myapi

Or set the `BUILDPACK_URL` config var on an existing app:

    heroku config:set BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/svenanders/heroku-apigility

## Stack

* NGINX 1.4 or 1.5
* PHP 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5, with [ZendOpcache][] and [APCu][] ([Info](https://chh-php-test.herokuapp.com/info))
* PHP-FPM

[ZendOpcache]: http://pecl.php.net/package/ZendOpcache
[APCu]: http://pecl.php.net/package/apcu
[Available PHP Versions]: http://chh-heroku-buildpack-php.s3.amazonaws.com/manifest.php
[Available NGINX Versions]: http://chh-heroku-buildpack-php.s3.amazonaws.com/manifest.nginx

## Detection

This buildpack detects apps when the app has a `composer.lock` in the
app's root.

If an `index.php` is detected in the app's root, then it switches to
"classic mode", which means that every ".php" file is served with PHP,
and the document root is set to the app root.

When a `composer.lock` is detected, then the buildpack does `composer
install --no-dev`.

## Environment

This buildpack sets environment variables during compile and runtime:

* `HEROKU_BUILD_TIME`: Time when the slug was compiled. Format is `%Y%m%d%H%M%S`, e.g. `20131103111548`

This buildpack also detects when the app has a node `package.json` in the
app's root. And will install node dependencies like less for example.

## Extensions

When the buildpack encounters `ext-` requirements in your `composer.json`, it will look
up the extension name in the [supported extensions](support/ext) and install them.

The version constraint is ignored currently.

For example, to install the Sundown extension:

```
{
    "require": {
        "ext-sundown": "*"
    }
}
```

##Logging

This buildpack defines default log files by framework.
It also defines log files nginx and php.

## Configuration

Configuration is done via a file named `composer.json` in the app's
root.

A simple configuration could look like this:

    {
        "require": {
            "php": ">=5.4.0",
            "silex/silex": "~1.0@dev"
        },
        "extra": {
            "heroku": {
                "document-root": "web",
                "index-document": "index.php"
            }
        }
    }

This configures an app with the document root set to the project's `web`
directory, and sets that all requests should go through `web/index.php`
which contains the application's front controller.

### Configuration Directives

This buildpack supports configuration through directives placed in the `heroku`
key in the `extra` object.

#### engines

Set PHP and NGINX versions.

To launch the app with PHP 5.3.23 and NGINX 1.3.14:

    "engines": {
        "php": "5.3.23",
        "nginx": "1.3.14"
    }

Set the version to "default" to use the current default version. The current
default versions are NGINX `1.4.2` and PHP `5.5.3`.

The version identifiers can also include wildcards, e.g. `5.4.*`. At the
time of writing, PHP `5.4.19` would be used in this case. This also
works for NGINX.

When a file named `.php-version` exists in the project root, then the
PHP version is read from this file instead.

* [Available NGINX Versions][]
* [Available PHP Versions][]

#### php-config

_Default: []_

Add directives to the `php.ini`.

    "php-config": [
        "display_errors=off",
        "short_open_tag=on"
    ]

#### php-includes

_Default: []_

Include additional .ini files that should be parsed after the default php.ini. File paths
are treated relative to the app root.

Example:

    "php-includes": ["etc/php.ini"]

#### nginx-includes

_Default: []_

Include additional config files into the NGINX configuration. Config
files are included into the `server` scope and are loaded after the
framework provided config. File paths are treated relative to the app
root.

Example:

    "nginx-includes": ["etc/nginx.conf"]

#### compile

_Default: []_

Run console commands on slug compilation.

    "compile": [
        "php app/console assetic:dump --env=prod --no-debug"
    ]

_Note: pecl is not runnable this way._

#### newrelic

_Default: false_

Enable instrumentation support via [New Relic](http://newrelic.com).
It's recommended to add the New Relic addon to your Heroku app, but you
can also set your license key manually by setting the `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` config var via `heroku config:set`.

    "newrelic": true

#### log-files

_Default: []_

The buildpack defines default log files by framework and some log files for php-fpm and nginx.
Any file put in `log-files` will be be appended to the list.
A tail on each unique log file will be run at application startup

    "log-files": [
        "app/logs/rabbit-mq.log",
        "vendor/nginx/stuff.log"
    ],


## Node.Js

If your app contains a `package.json` node and its dependencies will be installed

The nodejs buildpack is based on the [heroku diet node.js buildpack](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs/tree/diet).
This diet branch of the buildpack is intended to replace the official Node.js buildpack once it has been tested by some users.

It :
- Uses the latest stable version of node and npm by default.
- Allows any recent version of node to be used, including pre-release versions, as soon as they become available on [nodejs.org/dist](http://nodejs.org/dist/).
- Uses the version of npm that comes bundled with node instead of downloading and compiling them separately. npm has been bundled with node since [v0.6.3 (Nov 2011)](http://blog.nodejs.org/2011/11/25/node-v0-6-3/). This effectively means that node versions `<0.6.3` are no longer supported, and that the `engines.npm` field in package.json is now ignored.
- Makes use of an s3 caching proxy of nodejs.org for faster downloads of the node binaries.
- Makes fewer HTTP requests when resolving node versions.
- Uses an updated version of [node-semver](https://github.com/isaacs/node-semver) for dependency resolution.
- No longer depends on SCONS.
- Caches the `node_modules` directory across builds.
- Runs `npm prune` after restoring cached modules, to ensure that any modules formerly used by your app aren't needlessly installed and/or compiled.

A minimal `package.json` file with less will look like this :
```json
{
    "author": "Your Name",
    "name": "App",
    "dependencies": {
        "less": ">= 1.4.*"
    }
}
```

Node and its modules will be available at compilation meaning you could process nodejs script at that time.
